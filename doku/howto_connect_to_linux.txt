sudo killall rfcomm
sudo rfcomm release 0
sudo rfcomm bind 0 30:AE:A4:73:83:06


If the command doesnâ€™t work, probably you opened the serial monitor on arduino IDE.

This step might be as daunting as the previous one. You may have screen package installed to your computer. Run the command below by opening another terminal tab

sudo screen /dev/rfcomm0
